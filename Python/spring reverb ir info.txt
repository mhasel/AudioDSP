60 Classic and King Tubby style spring reverb impulse responses for convolution reverb

The sound quality of convolution processing relies heavily on the impulse responses used. But in the case of spring reverb a high quality recording is not enough. You need dirt as well. So if you want real dub flavour inna oldskool Jamaican style for your convolution ting you've come to the right place. Enjoy!
